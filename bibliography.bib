	doi = {10.1016/j.aquabot.2008.01.009},
	abstract = {The last 20 years witnessed a real paradigm shift concerning the impact of biotic factors on ecosystem functions as well as on vegetation structure of mangrove forests. Before this small scientific revolution took place, structural aspects of mangrove forests were viewed to be the result of abiotic processes acting from the bottom-up, while, at ecosystem level, the outwelling hypothesis stated that mangroves primary production was removed via tidal action and carried to adjacent nearshore ecosystems where it fuelled detrital based food-webs. The sesarmid crabs were the first macrofaunal taxon to be considered a main actor in mangrove structuring processes, thanks to a number of studies carried out in the Indo-Pacific forests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following these classical papers, a number of studies on Sesarmidae feeding and burrowing ecology were carried out, which leave no doubts about the great importance of these herbivorous crabs in structuring and functioning Old world ecosystems. Although Sesarmidae are still considered very important in shaping mangrove structure and functioning, recent literature emphasizes the significance of other invertebrates. The Ocypodidae have now been shown to have the same role as Sesarmidae in terms of retention of forest products and organic matter processing in New world mangroves. In both New and Old world mangroves, crabs process large amounts of algal primary production, contribute consistently to retention of mangrove production and as ecosystem engineers, change particle size distribution and enhance soil aeration. Our understanding of the strong impact of gastropods, by means of high intake rates of mangrove products and differential consumption of propagules, has changed only recently. The role of insects must also be stressed. It is now clear that older techniques used to assess herbivory rates by insects strongly underestimate their impact, both in case of leaf eating and wood boring species and that herbivorous insects can potentially play a strong role in many aspects of mangrove ecology. Moreover, researchers only recently realized that ant–plant interactions may form an important contribution to our understanding of insect–plant dynamics in these habitats. Ants seem to be able to relieve mangroves from important herbivores such as many insects and sesarmid crabs. It thus seems likely that ants have positive effects on mangrove performance.},

Addressing this problem in a unified way, Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications provides complete coverage of the entire area of clustering, from basic methods to more refined and complex data clustering approaches. It pays special attention to recent issues in graphs, social networks, and other domains.The book focuses on three primary aspects of data clustering:  Methods, describing key techniques commonly used for clustering, such as feature selection, agglomerative clustering, partitional clustering, density-based clustering, probabilistic clustering, grid-based clustering, spectral clustering, and nonnegative matrix factorization Domains, covering methods used for different domains of data, such as categorical data, text data, multimedia data, graph data, biological data, stream data, uncertain data, time series clustering, high-dimensional clustering, and big data  Variations and Insights, discussing important variations of the clustering process, such as semisupervised clustering, interactive clustering, multiview clustering, cluster ensembles, and cluster validation In this book, top researchers from around the world explore the characteristics of clustering problems in a variety of application areas. They also explain how to glean detailed insight from the clustering process—including how to verify the quality of the underlying clusters—through supervision, human intervention, or the automated generation of alternative clusters.},

Thirteen countries have carried out reintroduction programmes to restore the range of the Beaver in Europe, We provide a basis for discussing the feasibility and desirability of reintroducing the Beaver to Britain. The basic biology of the Beaver is described, followed by summaries of reintroductions in Europe and an evaluation of their successes and failures. We address the fundamental questions of propagule size, habitat requirements, habitat size and provenance of Beavers to be released, before examining in theory whether reintroducing Beavers to Britain is likely to fulfil UKCINC and IUCN criteria relating to environmental impact, socioeconomics and conservation. We then make suggestions as to how a reintroduction to Britain could proceed. Essential work outstanding includes site assessment and public consultation.

About 80\% of the adult females were fertile and the number of young per litter averaged 2.7. The annual mortality rate of beavers was about 30\% in southeastern Newfoundland. A more detailed study was made of a population living in a 39-km2 (15-mi2) study area. This population had 20, 23, and 24 active colonies, 1958–1960. In 1961 it declined to 18 colonies. We removed the beavers in 1962. The replacement colonies, resulting initially from ingress, were 7 in 1962, 12 in 1963, 17 in 1964, and 15 in 1965. When the population was high in 1958–1960, the fertility of females was high (78\%) but the litter size in 1960 appeared to be less than elsewhere. When the population declined in 1960–1961, productivity declined and some animals may have starved over winter.

	abstract = {Mean global temperatures have risen this century, and further warming is predicted to continue for the next 50–100 years. Some migratory species can respond rapidly to yearly climate variation by altering the timing or destination of migration, but most wildlife is sedentary and so is incapable of such a rapid response. For these species, responses to the warming trend should be slower, reflected in poleward shifts of the range. Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population, stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals' movements, but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range. A northward range shift therefore occurs when there is net extinction at the southern boundary or net colonization at the northern boundary. However, previous evidence has been limited to a single species or to only a portion of the species' range,. Here we provide the first large-scale evidence of poleward shifts in entire species' ranges. In a sample of 35 non-migratory European butterflies, 63\% have ranges that have shifted to the north by 35–240 km during this century, and only 3\% have shifted to the south.},

	abstract = {The duality between “niche” and “biotope” proposed by G. Evelyn Hutchinson provides a powerful way to conceptualize and analyze biogeographical distributions in relation to spatial environmental patterns. Both Joseph Grinnell and Charles Elton had attributed niches to environments. Attributing niches, instead, to species, allowed Hutchinson's key innovation: the formal severing of physical place from environment that is expressed by the duality. In biogeography, the physical world (a spatial extension of what Hutchinson called the biotope) is conceived as a map, each point (or cell) of which is characterized by its geographical coordinates and the local values of n environmental attributes at a given time. Exactly the same n environmental attributes define the corresponding niche space, as niche axes, allowing reciprocal projections between the geographic distribution of a species, actual or potential, past or future, and its niche. In biogeographical terms, the realized niche has come to express not only the effects of species interactions (as Hutchinson intended), but also constraints of dispersal limitation and the lack of contemporary environments corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche. Hutchinson's duality has been used to classify and map environments; model potential species distributions under past, present, and future climates; study the distributions of invasive species; discover new species; and simulate increasingly more realistic worlds, leading to spatially explicit, stochastic models that encompass speciation, extinction, range expansion, and evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.},

	abstract = {This book provides a first synthetic view of an emerging area of ecology and biogeography, linking individual- and population-level processes to geographic distributions and biodiversity patterns. Problems in evolutionary ecology, macroecology, and biogeography are illuminated by this integrative view. The book focuses on correlative approaches known as ecological niche modeling, species distribution modeling, or habitat suitability modeling, which use associations between known occurrences of species and environmental variables to identify environmental conditions under which populations can be maintained. The spatial distribution of environments suitable for the species can then be estimated: a potential distribution for the species. This approach has broad applicability to ecology, evolution, biogeography, and conservation biology, as well as to understanding the geographic potential of invasive species and infectious diseases, and the biological implications of climate change.  The authors lay out conceptual foundations and general principles for understanding and interpreting species distributions with respect to geography and environment. Focus is on development of niche models. While serving as a guide for students and researchers, the book also provides a theoretical framework to support future progress in the field.},

This book--a seminal study in its field--provides a simple yet eloquent introduction to the discipline, explaining what a dendrochronologist does both in the field and in the laboratory.    Authors Stokes and Smiley first explain the basic principles of tree-ring dating, then describe details of the process, step by step, from the time a sample is collected until it is incorporated into a master chronology.      The book focuses on coniferous evergreens of the Southwest, particularly piñons, because they have wide geographic distribution, constitute a large population, and show excellent growth response to certain controlling factors.  The book is specifically concerned with the task of establishing a calendar date for a wood or charcoal specimen.    This concise but thorough explication of an important discipline will make dendrochonology more meaningful to students and professionals in archaeology, forestry, hydrology, and global change.},

This assumption has driven basic and applied ecological and evolutionary hypotheses about the causes of species range limits and their responses to climate change. Here, we review recent studies that are taking biogeographical ecology beyond previously held assumptions by observing populations in the field across large parts of the species range. When these studies combine data on abundance, demographics, organismal physiology, genetics and physical factors, they provide a promising approach for teasing out ecological and evolutionary mechanisms of the patterns and processes underlying species ranges.},

	abstract = {Abstract We used radiotelemetry to estimate natal dispersal patterns and survival rates of 13 yearling and 19 subadult beavers (Castor canadensis) at two geomorphologically different sites in southern Illinois. Overall, we observed a 55\% dispersal rate for yearlings and a 73\% dispersal rate for subadults. Normally, juveniles (yearlings + subadults) initiated dispersal around 16 February (range = 28 Jan.–20 Mar.) and settled around 18 April, with juveniles remaining transient from late January through late June. Nine subadult beavers dispersed significantly earlier at one site (x̄ = 25 Nov., range = 31 Oct.–16 Dec.), presumably due to intra-colony strife brought on by management-induced autumn flooding of wetlands for waterfowl. Dispersal occurred earlier than documented in northern regions. Beavers dispersed farther from natal colonies with free-flowing water access (x̄ = 5.9 km) than those landlocked (x̄ = 1.7 km). Males moved more frequently and traveled greater distances per individual move than did females, but overall dispersal distances were similar between sexes. Dispersal distances of beavers with access to free-flowing waterways generally were similar to other studies. Survival during dispersal was greater for beavers emigrating from lodges on the land-locked, less densely populated site (0.80), than for those dispersing in an area of higher population densities (0.43), but did not differ between dispersers and non-dispersers at either site.},

	abstract = {The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.
A meta-analysis shows that species are shifting their distributions in response to climate change at an accelerating rate.

	abstract = {Explaining the causes of regular multi annual oscillations (cycles) in animal populations has been a major problem for ecology, partly due to a lack of methodological rigor. In this paper we show how the analysis of R-functions, the functional relationship between the per capita rate of change of a species and components of its environment, can be used to detect the causes of population cycles. Analysis of the R-functions enables one to separate cycles due to negative feedback between species (endogenous causes) from those forced by one-way effects (exogenous causes). We illustrate the approach by reference to the spruce needle-miner inhabiting Danish spruce plantations, and conclude that population cycles in this insect are probably caused by interactions with two species of parasitic hymenoptera.},

The book will endure in future ages so long as a knowledge of science persists among mankind." — NatureIt took Charles Darwin more than twenty years to publish this book, in part because he realized that it would ignite a firestorm of controversy. On the Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world.In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory.

	abstract = {This book is a review and description of the state-of-the-art methods of tree-ring analy{\textasciitilde}is with specific emphasis on applications in the environmental sciences. Traditionally, methods of tree-ring analysis, or more properly in this case methods 0/ dendrochronology, were developed and used for dating archaeological and historical structures and for reconstructing past climates. The classic book Tree Rings and Climate, by H.C. Fritts, published in 1976, provided a superb introduction to the science and an in-depth description of techniques useful for extracting climatic information from tree rings. This book, which was published by Academic Press, is sadly out of print and, even though only 12 years old, lim ited in its methods and applications. This is owing to the extremely rapid development of the science since the 1970s. Only recently have tree rings as environmental sensors been fully recog nized as a valuable tool in detecting environmental change. For example, tree ring measurements have been critically important in studies of forest decline in Europe and North America. There are also attempts to use tree-ring analysis for ecological prognosis to solve large-scale regional problems including the sustain ability of water supplies, prediction of agricultural crops, and adoption of silvi cultural measures in response to ecological changes. More speculatively, dendro chronological methods are also used for dating and evaluating some astrophysical phenomena and for indicating possible increase in the biospheric carrying capac ity due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

Due to an increasing demand for chemical diversity in screening programs, seeking therapeutic drugs from natural products, interest particularly in edible plants has grown throughout the world. Botanicals and herbal preparations for medicinal usage contain various types of bioactive compounds. The focus of this paper is on the analytical methodologies, which include the extraction, isolation and characterization of active ingredients in botanicals and herbal preparations. The common problems and key challenges in the extraction, isolation and characterization of active ingredients in botanicals and herbal preparations are discussed. As extraction is the most important step in the analysis of constituents present in botanicals and herbal preparations, the strengths and weaknesses of different extraction techniques are discussed. The analysis of bioactive compounds present in the plant extracts involving the applications of common phytochemical screening assays, chromatographic techniques such as HPLC and, TLC as well as non-chromatographic techniques such as immunoassay and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) are discussed.},

	abstract = {Fire is one of the most important natural disturbance processes in the western United States and ecosystems differ markedly with respect to their ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Reference fire regimes in forested ecosystems can be categorized along a gradient ranging from “fuel-limited” to “climate-limited” where the former types are often characterized by frequent, lower-severity wildfires and the latter by infrequent, more severe wildfires. Using spatial data on fire severity from 1984–2011 and metrics related to fire frequency, we tested how divergence from historic (pre-Euroamerican settlement) fire frequencies due to a century of fire suppression influences rates of high-severity fire in five forest types in California. With some variation among bioregions, our results suggest that fires in forest types characterized by fuel-limited fire regimes (e.g., yellow pine and mixed conifer forest) tend to burn with greater proportions of high-severity fire as either time since last fire or the mean modern fire return interval (FRI) increases. Two intermediate fire regime types (mixed evergreen and bigcone Douglas-fir) showed a similar relationship between fire frequency and fire severity. However, red fir and redwood forests, which are characterized by more climate-limited fire regimes, did not show significant positive relationships between FRI and fire severity. This analysis provides strong evidence that for fuel-limited fire regimes, lack of fire leads to increasing rates of high-severity burning. Our study also substantiates the general validity of “fuel-limited” vs. “climate-limited” explanations of differing patterns of fire effects and response in forest types of the western US.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYThe voluntary feed and water intakes of five llama × guanaco crossbreds (New World camelids) and five sheep, and their abilities to digest various feed components and to utilize nitrogen, were compared using a diet of threshed ryegrass straw in New Zealand in 1987.The camelids ate more than the sheep, but intakes were similar relative to metabolic live weight (mean 37·6 g dry matter/kg W0·75 per day). They drank 0·62 times as much water as sheep per kg W0·75, and 0·57 times as much per g DM intake (P {\textless} 0·05). Mean apparent digestibilities of dry matter (47.7\%), energy (41·6\%) and cell-wall fractions (48·4\%) were similar in both species, in spite of the sheep selecting a higher-N component of the diet. Variation in digestibility (e.g. organic matter digestibility) among individual sheep was inversely associated with the percentage of cell-wall constituents consumed. The faeces of camelids contained a significantly higher proportion of particles longer than 0·5mm than those of the sheep (17 v. 11\% total DM), indicating a slightly larger threshold to passage from the forestomachs in the camelids.All animals were in negative N balance during the trial, but net loss of N was less in the camelids than in the sheep (27·6 and 49·5 g N/100 g N intake, respectively; P {\textless} 0·05), because of lower urinary N excretion (36·5 and 60·3 g N/100 g N intake, respectively; P {\textless} 0·05) of the camelids. The results suggest that camelids may be better suited than ruminants for production from poor-quality feeds, especially if water supply is limited.},

	abstract = {Beavers can and do dramatically change the landscape. The beaver is a keystone species—their skills as foresters and engineers create and maintain ponds and wetlands that increase biodiversity, purify water, and prevent large-scale flooding. Biologists have long studied their daily and seasonal routines, family structures, and dispersal patterns. As human development encroaches into formerly wild areas, property owners and government authorities need new, nonlethal strategies for dealing with so-called nuisance beavers. At the same time, the complex behavior of beavers intrigues visitors at parks and other wildlife viewing sites because it is relatively easy to observe.In an up-to-date, exhaustively illustrated, and comprehensive book on beaver biology and management, Dietland Müller-Schwarze and Lixing Sun gather a wealth of scientific knowledge about both the North American and Eurasian beaver species. The Beaver is designed to satisfy the curiosity and answer the questions of anyone with an interest in these animals, from students who enjoy watching beaver ponds at nature centers to homeowners who hope to protect their landscaping. Photographs taken by the authors document every aspect of beaver behavior and biology, the variety of their constructions, and the habitats that depend on their presence.  Beaver facts:•Just as individual beavers shape their immediate surroundings, so did the distribution of beavers across North America influence the paths of English and French explorers and traders. As a result of the fur trade, beavers were wiped out across large areas of the United States. Reintroduction efforts led to the widespread establishment of these resilient animals, and now they are found throughout North America, Europe, and parts of the southern hemisphere.•Beaver meadows provided early settlers with level, fertile pastures and hayfields.•Based on the fossil record, the smallest extinct beaver species were the size of a muskrat, and the largest may have reached the size of a black bear (five to six times as large as today's North American beavers). Beaver-gnawed wood has been found alongside the skeleton of a mastodon.•Some beavers remain in the home lodge for an extra year to assist their parents in raising younger siblings. They feed, groom, and guard the newborn kits.•In 1600, beaver ponds covered eleven percent of the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers' watershed above Thebes, Illinois. Restoring only 3 percent of the original wetlands might suffice to prevent catastrophic floods such as those in the early 1990s.},

In the second, he reviews the various approaches to explaining observed correlation between plant distribution and climate, and to establishing the mechanisms of control in physiological and biochemical terms. Dr Woodward is an authority on plant-climate relationships, and has made some of the most important contributions to our understanding of the subject. This book builds on his extensive knowledge of the subject to provide a modern text on this basic problem of plant ecology, encompassing the techniques of palaeoecology, climatology, ecology, physiology, biochemistry and genetics.},

Although coarse structuring of niche space between different guilds is generally accepted, it is not clear how niches differ within guilds, or whether there is fine-grained niche differentiation reflected in echolocation signal structure. Using a standardized performance test, here we show clutter-dependent differences in prey-capture success for bats from five species of European Myotis. These species are morphologically similar, sympatric, and all belong to the guild labelled "edge space aerial/trawling foragers". We further demonstrate a strong correlation between the prey-detection ability of the species and the respective search-call bandwidth. Our findings indicate that differences in echolocation signals contribute to within-guild niche differentiation. This is the first study relating sensory abilities of a set of potentially competing animal species to a direct measure of their respective foraging performance, suggesting an important role of sensory ecology in the structuring of animal communities.},

	abstract = {Significant relationships among morphology, behavior, performance and fitness have long served as bona fide evidence for the role of selection in shaping natural populations. Here, I discuss how studies of ecological performance, or how organisms perform in nature, provide an ecological context for such selection studies. Laboratory studies assume that the level of performance expressed under “optimal” conditions accurately reflects the level of performance used in nature, but I show here that this assumption is not always borne out. A review of how various factors affect ecological performance (ontogeny, microhabitat, and macrohabitat) show that animals often express very different levels of movement speed both among different tasks, and when comparing laboratory versus field performance. Thus, a failure to take this variation into account could lead to negative, or even misleading significant fitness-character correlations. While laboratory performance studies should continue to play a key role in studies of selection, recent technological (i.e., portable high-speed cameras) and methodological developments should enable researchers to measure performance in nature to high degrees of accuracy. Thus, I encourage researchers to measure performance both in the laboratory and in the field, and thus expand the traditional paradigm of morphology → performance → fitness to morphology → ecological performance → fitness.},

Gaston discusses the structure of these distributions - the structure of the geographic ranges of species. Gaston is particularly concerned with the factors that determine the limits to a species' geographic range, how the sizes of those ranges vary, and patterns in that variation. Also considered are the distribution of individuals amongst those sites where a species does occur and what determines that distribution, and some of the practical implications of all these. Both in a pure and applied context, ecologists need a broader perspective on their subject matter than has historically prevailed. This book provides one such perspective.

This surpasses the 10\% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress, for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned. In practice, however, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity. We show that the global network is far from complete, and demonstrate the inadequacy of uniform—that is, 'one size fits all'—conservation targets.},

	abstract = {* 1 Theory suggests that territorial species should share many of the same dynamical characteristics as metapopulations, including asynchronous local dynamics, potential for stochastic extinction of the population when rates of successful dispersal fall below mortality risk, and critical importance of the ratio of suitable to unsuitable habitat for long-term persistence. These propositions were tested on a population of beavers (Castor canadensis Kuhl) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, which has been continuously monitored over 11 years.
* 2 Results showed that the total population was considerably less variable than local abundance at 14 beaver colonies, due to asynchrony among local populations. This suggests that local ecological interactions were more important in determining year-to-year variation in beaver numbers than broad-scale environmental processes, such as weather.
* 3 Of the local colonies, 20\% were never abandoned over 11 years, although there was considerable turnover among adults. Offspring production exceeded adult abundance at five source colonies, which did not quite compensate for negative net production at nine sink colonies. These observations were consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality incorporating local variation in habitat suitability. Mean colony size and probability of recurrence from year-to-year were associated with local food availability, indicating that trophic interactions were important in determining local population dynamics.
* 4 The beaver population in Algonquin declined steadily over the study period, however, suggesting that spatial and demographic processes were insufficient to stabilize abundance over time. This is consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality in which suitable and unsuitable habitats are interspersed. It is hypothesized that long-term decline in habitat suitability is induced by acceleration of woody plant succession due to selective foraging by beavers.},

	abstract = {Genetic and paleoanthropological evidence is in accord that today’s human population is the result of a great demic (demographic and geographic) expansion that began approximately 45,000 to 60,000 y ago in Africa and rapidly resulted in human occupation of almost all of the Earth’s habitable regions. Genomic data from contemporary humans suggest that this expansion was accompanied by a continuous loss of genetic diversity, a result of what is called the “serial founder effect.” In addition to genomic data, the serial founder effect model is now supported by the genetics of human parasites, morphology, and linguistics. This particular population history gave rise to the two defining features of genetic variation in humans: genomes from the substructured populations of Africa retain an exceptional number of unique variants, and there is a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity within populations living outside of Africa. These two patterns are relevant for medical genetic studies mapping genotypes to phenotypes and for inferring the power of natural selection in human history. It should be appreciated that the initial expansion and subsequent serial founder effect were determined by demographic and sociocultural factors associated with hunter-gatherer populations. How do we reconcile this major demic expansion with the population stability that followed for thousands years until the inventions of agriculture? We review advances in understanding the genetic diversity within Africa and the great human expansion out of Africa and offer hypotheses that can help to establish a more synthetic view of modern human evolution.},

	abstract = {Much as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was a call to action against the pesticides that were devastating bird populations, Charles S. Elton's classic The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants sounded an early warning about an environmental catastrophe that has become all too familiar today—the invasion of nonnative species. From kudzu to zebra mussels to Asian long-horned beetles, nonnative species are colonizing new habitats around the world at an alarming rate thanks to accidental and intentional human intervention. One of the leading causes of extinctions of native animals and plants, invasive species also wreak severe economic havoc, causing \$79 billion worth of damage in the United States alone.Elton explains the devastating effects that invasive species can have on local ecosystems in clear, concise language and with numerous examples. The first book on invasion biology, and still the most cited, Elton's masterpiece provides an accessible, engaging introduction to one of the most important environmental crises of our time.Charles S. Elton was one of the founders of ecology, who also established and led Oxford University's Bureau of Animal Population. His work has influenced generations of ecologists and zoologists, and his publications remain central to the literature in modern biology."History has caught up with Charles Elton's foresight, and The Ecology of Invasions can now be seen as one of the central scientific books of our century."—David Quammen, from the Foreword to Killer Algae: The True Tale of a Biological Invasion},

The study addressed the questions of whether or not the frequency of scent-mound construction varied with season, site, year, and degree of contact with other family groups, and whether the pattern of scent-mounding activity was parsimonious with the idea of “territorial marking.” The number of scent-mounds constructed was determined weekly for each site throughout the ice-free season. Scent-mounding activity was highest in spring and declined and remained low during summer and fall. Significant differences were found amoung sites and over years. Contact with other resident family groups altered both frequency and pattern of scent-mound construction. Scent-mounds did not conform to a “scent-fence” model. The most parsimonious interpretation of function of odor cues deposited on scent-mounds is the effect on the motivational state of residents and nonresidents, increasing the confidence and reducing anxiety in residents smelling their own scent-mound and decreasing the confidence and increasing the readiness to flee in trespassers encountering a strange scent-mound.},

It is very appropriate that the leading exponents in this field have come together to produce an authoritative description on 'how to do it'. They bring with them many years of experience in this research area. This book is a must for all those involved in estimating animal abundance as the methods can be used for such a wide variety of animal species including birds and marine mammals. The methods also apply to clusters of animals such as schools of dolphins and to animal signs. The beauty of such methods lies in the fact that not every animal has to be seen when a population is investigated. At the heart of the methodology is a 'detectability' function which is estimated in some robust fashion from the distances to the animals actually seen. Many species are not always visible and may be detected by the sounds they make or by being flushed out into the open. Clearly animals can have widely different behaviour patterns so that different models will be needed for different situations. This book provides a tool box of such methods with a computer package which helps the researcher to select the right tool for each occasion. The authors have a reputation for being very thorough and, typically, they endeavour to cover every conceivable situation that might be encountered in the field.},

In this text, a general theoretical basis is established for methods of estimating animal abundance from sightings surveys, and a wide range of approaches to analysis of sightings data is explored. These approaches include: modelling animal detectability as a function of covariates, where the effects of habitat, observer, weather, etc. on detectability can be assessed; estimating animal density as a function of location, allowing for example animal density to be related to habitat and other locational covariates; estimating change over time in populations, a necessary aspect of any monitoring program; estimation when detection of animals on the line or at the point is uncertain, as often occurs for marine populations, or when the survey region has dense cover; survey design and automated design algorithms, allowing rapid generation of sound survey designs using geographic information systems; adaptive distance sampling methods, which concentrate survey effort in areas of high animal density; passive distance sampling methods, which extend the application of distance sampling to species that cannot be readily detected in sightings surveys, but can be trapped; and testing of methods by simulation, so that performance of the approach in varying circumstances can be assessed.},

* 2The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) guidelines for reintroductions state that ‘the source population should ideally be closely related genetically to the original native stock’.
* 3Palaeoecological studies suggest that the species survived the last Ice Age in two refugia: in the west in Iberia and Southern France and in the east in the Black Sea region. The post-Ice Age population of Western Europe, including Great Britain, recolonized from the western refugium. Recent mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid studies strongly support this view, and extant beaver populations are clearly divided into eastern and western evolutionarily significant units (ESUs).
* 4The western ESU is composed of three stocks which survived the 19th and early 20th century as very small, isolated populations. They are very closely related to each other. Each is genetically depauperate, apparently as a result of genetic drift at low population levels.
* 5There is evidence of inbreeding depression and of phenotypic abnormalities in beaver populations descended from unmixed stocks.
* 6The evidence suggests three coherent management options for sourcing reintroduction stock for Great Britain and for unoccupied areas of western continental Europe. These are (i) use animals from a single western ESU stock; (ii) intentionally mix animals from two or all three of the surviving western ESU stocks; (iii) make an informed exception to the IUCN guidelines and reintroduce animals of mixed eastern and western ESU provenance.
* 7These options are discussed with regard to IUCN guidelines, conservation biology and animal welfare considerations. It would be advantageous if a common policy on the origin of reintroduction stock were agreed by the national agencies responsible.},

Also considered are the distribution of individuals amongst those sites where a species does occur and what determines that distribution, and some of the practical implications of all these. Both in a pure and applied context, ecologists need a broader perspective on their subject matter than has historically prevailed. This book provides one such perspective.

In this book Elton introduced and drew together many principles still central to ecology today, including succession, niche, food webs, and the links between communities and ecosystems, each of which he illustrated with well-chosen examples. Many of Elton's ideas have proven remarkably prescient—for instance, his emphasis on the role climatic changes play in population fluctuations anticipated recent research in this area stimulated by concerns about global warming.For Chicago's reprint of this classic work, ecologists Mathew A. Leibold and J. Timothy Wootton have provided new introductions to each chapter, placing Elton's ideas in historical and scientific context. They trace modern developments in each of the key themes Elton introduced, and provide references to the most current literature. The result will be an important work for ecologists interested in the roots of their discipline, for educated readers looking for a good overview of the field, and for historians of science.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1210251109},
	abstract = {The benefits of protected areas (PAs) for biodiversity have been questioned in the context of climate change because PAs are static, whereas the distributions of species are dynamic. Current PAs may, however, continue to be important if they provide suitable locations for species to colonize at their leading-edge range boundaries, thereby enabling spread into new regions. Here, we present an empirical assessment of the role of PAs as targets for colonization during recent range expansions. Records from intensive surveys revealed that seven bird and butterfly species have colonized PAs 4.2 (median) times more frequently than expected from the availability of PAs in the landscapes colonized. Records of an additional 256 invertebrate species with less-intensive surveys supported these findings and showed that 98\% of species are disproportionately associated with PAs in newly colonized parts of their ranges. Although colonizing species favor PAs in general, species vary greatly in their reliance on PAs, reflecting differences in the dependence of individual species on particular habitats and other conditions that are available only in PAs. These findings highlight the importance of current PAs for facilitating range expansions and show that a small subset of the landscape receives a high proportion of colonizations by range-expanding species.},

	abstract = {Nests, roosts, and dens are an important facet of life for many animals and often provide refuge from weather and predators. Reproduction, particularly lactation, is energetically expensive. Many small mammals form maternity colonies in sheltered locations, which provides protection for offspring and mitigates the cost of staying warm. However, lasiurine bats give birth in roosts that superficially appear to offer relatively little thermal buffer. Given the consequences of a cold environment on offspring growth and the high energetic demand of thermoregulating and lactating concurrently, choosing roosts with certain microclimatic properties would be beneficial. We investigated the influence of microclimate on roost selection by lactating hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus (Beauvois, 1796)), a solitary foliage-roosting species. We found that roosts chosen by bats offered shelter from the wind and exposure to sunlight, and consistently had an opening that faced south. We suggest that lactating L. cinereus choose..., Les nids, les perchoirs et les terriers représentent des aspects importants de la vie de nombreux animaux et fournissent souvent un refuge contre le climat et les prédateurs. La reproduction, et en particulier l’allaitement, ont un coût énergétique élevé. Plusieurs petits mammifères forment des colonies de maternité dans des sites abrités qui procurent une protection aux petits et réduisent les coûts du maintien de la chaleur. Cependant, les chauves-souris lasiurinées donnent naissance dans des perchoirs qui, au premier abord, semblent fournir un tampon thermique relativement faible. Compte tenu des conséquences d’un environnement froid sur la croissance des rejetons et des exigences énergétiques importantes conjointes de l’allaitement et de la thermorégulation, il leur serait avantageux de choisir des perchoirs avec certaines propriétés microclimatiques. Nous examinons l’influence du microclimat sur le choix du perchoir chez des chauves-souris cendrées (Lasiurus cinereus (Beauvois, 1796)), une espèce sol...},

	abstract = {We asked two research questions: (1) What are the relative effects of climate change and climate-driven vegetation shifts on different components of future fire regimes? (2) How does incorporating climate-driven vegetation change into future fire regime projections alter the results compared to projections based only on direct climate effects? We used the western United States (US) as study area to answer these questions. Future (2071–2100) fire regimes were projected using statistical models to predict spatial patterns of occurrence, size and spread for large fires (\&gt; 400 ha) and a simulation experiment was conducted to compare the direct climatic effects and the indirect effects of climate-driven vegetation change on fire regimes. Results showed that vegetation change amplified climate-driven increases in fire frequency and size and had a larger overall effect on future total burned area in the western US than direct climate effects. Vegetation shifts, which were highly sensitive to precipitation pattern changes, were also a strong determinant of the future spatial pattern of burn rates and had different effects on fire in currently forested and grass/shrub areas. Our results showed that climate-driven vegetation change can exert strong localized effects on fire occurrence and size, which in turn drive regional changes in fire regimes. The effects of vegetation change for projections of the geographic patterns of future fire regimes may be at least as important as the direct effects of climate change, emphasizing that accounting for changing vegetation patterns in models of future climate–fire relationships is necessary to provide accurate projections at continental to global scales.},
